# Clima 🌦

A weather app built with flutter ❤.
I have used open weather map's api for the weather updates.

It gives weather information of the current location or of any place you desire😉.

Wanna check out?

If you want to try out the app, you'll have to login or register on [open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/) and get your own [api key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).
Next you'll have to paste that api key in lib/services/weather.dart file where it says apiKey and your done!✌


Here's how it looks
